## New Feature Ideas

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Status:** Proposed - Not Yet Implemented  
**Context:** One place to note all ideas I have

#### Config settings saved in the cloud, pulled by device on initialization
- Config settings are baked into the firmware
- Frontend is not synched when firmware is reset
- Frontend should be the "source of truth"
- Config settings should be stored in the cloud when the frontend modifies them
- Firmware pulls the cloud config settings on boot.

# Session Log — Test Workflow Setup

## 2026-10-18 — orchestration run 1

Entry conditions: planning PR #78 merged to main (`0ccf1f2`). Branch `feat/test-workflow-setup` cut from main. Started from `RELAY-orchestrator.md`. PLAN Open Questions are all scheduled for in-phase resolution (Phase 1, Phase 3, Phase 5, W1); none blocks Phase 1. Firmware builds at HEAD (stacked Phase 23–25 debug build).

### Worker #1 — Phase 1: Firmware baselines

**Dispatch:**
```
Initiative: Test Workflow Setup
Phase: 1 — Firmware baselines
Initiative path: docs/initiatives/test-workflow-setup/
Additional reading: docs/research/v7-retry/test-workflow-audit.md §2.5; CL-25 in v6-v7-changelist.md (as the task names). Phase notes: build-only — do NOT flash v7-clean or v6-ref onto any board. Tags are created only after the build passes (v6-ref is tagged regardless, per task 4). Work on branch feat/test-workflow-setup.

Tasks assigned (from TASKS.md Phase 1):
- [~] Read `test-workflow-audit.md` §2.5 and CL-25 in `v6-v7-changelist.md`. Diff the I²C init in `SensorManager.cpp` between `4da1c67` and HEAD, and list the five debug changes, with line numbers, in SESSION.md
- [ ] Revert exactly those five changes and fix the boot-line text. Keep the diag paths and envs. Build every `motion-play-v7*` env
- [ ] Commit (the message states the I²C init in one line). Create the annotated tag `v7-clean` with the init line, `STARTUP_I2C_SCAN` value and the envs that build. Do not flash
- [ ] In a throwaway worktree on `4da1c67`, build the v6 env. Create the annotated tag `v6-ref` on `4da1c67` with its I²C init stated. If the build fails, record why in PLAN Open Questions and still tag (the tag is the source of truth, not the build cache)
- [ ] Push both tags. Remove the worktree
- [ ] 🔄 Handoff
```

#### Notes

**Task 1: I²C-init diff, `4da1c67` → HEAD (`843e7c2`), `firmware/src/components/sensor/SensorManager.cpp`, `SensorManager::init()`.**

`4da1c67` L636–638: `Wire.begin(43, 44);` / `Wire.setClock(400000);` / `Serial.println("I2C clock set to 400 kHz");`. Nothing else touches drive, filters or pulls.

The five debug changes at HEAD (line numbers at `843e7c2`):

| # | Change | Code lines | Comment lines | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Wire.setClock(100000)` (was 400000) | L642 | L640–641 | 22–23 |
| 2 | `gpio_set_drive_capability(GPIO_NUM_43/44, GPIO_DRIVE_CAP_3)` | L648–649 | L643–647 | 23 |
| 3 | `i2c_filter_enable(I2C_NUM_0, 7)` | L658 | L650–657 | 24 Exp 1 |
| 4 | IO_MUX `FUN_FILTER_EN` (`#define` fallback + `REG_SET_BIT(GPIO_PIN_MUX_REG[43/44], …)`) | L668–672 | L660–667 | 25 Exp 2 |
| 5 | `gpio_pullup_dis` / `gpio_pulldown_dis` on 43/44 | L680–683 | L674–679 | 25 Exp 3 |

Supporting lines that exist only for these five: the includes `<driver/gpio.h>`, `<driver/i2c.h>`, `<soc/io_mux_reg.h>` (L3–5; nothing else in the file uses them), and the stale boot line at L685–686 (`"I2C: 100 kHz, drive CAP_3, filter(7), pad-filter, internal pulls dis [Phase 24 null + Phase 25 bundle]"`).

The rest of the `SensorManager.cpp` diff (`selectChannelVerify`, per-channel scan on a 0x60 NACK, diag paths) is outside the I²C init and is kept. The other `Wire.begin(43, 44)` callers (`main.cpp` `configureBQ24195()`, and `InterruptManager` via `MuxController::begin(..., 400000)`) are the same as in the v6 era and are not part of the five. The restored clock is 400 kHz, which matches `4da1c67`.

DESCRIPTION
VCNL4040 integrates a proximity sensor (PS), ambient
light sensor (ALS), and a high power IRED into one small
package. It incorporates photodiodes, amplifiers, and
analog to digital converting circuits into a single chip by
CMOS process. The 16-bit high resolution ALS offers
excellent sensing capabilities with sufficient selections to
fulfill most applications whether dark or high transparency
lens design. High and low interrupt thresholds can be
programmed for both ALS and PS, allowing the component
to use a minimal amount of the microcontrollers resources.
The proximity sensor features an intelligent cancellation
scheme, so that cross talk phenomenon is eliminated
effectively. To accelerate the PS response time, smart
persistence prevents the misjudgment of proximity sensing
but also keeps a fast response time. In active force mode, a
single measurement can be requested, allowing another
good approach for more design flexibility to fulfill different
kinds of applications with more power saving.
The patented FiltronTM technology achieves ambient light
spectral sensitivity closest to real human eye response and
offers the best background light cancellation capability
(including sunlight) without utilizing the microcontrollers’
resources. VCNL4040 provides an excellent temperature
compensation capability for keeping output stable under
various temperature configurations. ALS and PS functions
are easily set via the simple command format of I2C
(SMBus compatible) interface protocol. Operating voltage
ranges from 2.5 V to 3.6 V. VCNL4040 is packaged in a
lead (Pb)-free 8-pin molding package, which offers the best
market-proven reliability quality.

APPLICATION INFORMATION
Pin Connection with the Host
VCNL4040 integrates proximity sensor, ambient light Sensor, and IRED all together with I2C interface. It is very easy for the
baseband (CPU) to access PS and ALS output data via I2C interface without extra software algorithms. The hardware schematic
is shown in the following diagram.
Two additional capacitors in the circuit can be used for the following purposes: (1) the 0.1 μF capacitor near the VDD pin is used
for power supply noise rejection, (2) the 2.2 μF capacitor - connected to the anode - is used to prevent the IRED voltage from
instantly dropping when the IRED is turned on, and (3) 2.2 kΩ is suitable for the pull up resistor of I2C except for the 8.2 kΩ
applied on the INT pin.

Digital Interface
VCNL4040 applies single slave address 0x60 (HEX) of 7-bit addressing following I2C protocol. As figure 12 shows, VCNL4040’s
I2C command format is simple for read and write operations between VCNL4040 and the host. The white sections indicate host
activity and the gray sections indicate VCNL4040’s acknowledgement of the host access activity. Write word and read word
protocol is suitable for accessing registers particularly for 16-bit data ALS and 12-bit / 16-bit PS data. Interrupt can be cleared
by reading data out from register: INT_Flag. All command codes should follow read word and write word protocols.

Function Description
VCNL4040 applies a 16-bit high resolution ALS that provides the best ambient light sensing capability down to 0.01 lux/step
which works well under a low transmittance lens design (dark lens). A flexible interrupt function of ALS (register: ALS_CONF)
is also supported. The INT signal will not be triggered by VCNL4040 if the ALS value is not over high INT threshold window level,
or lower than low INT threshold window level of ALS. VCNL4040 detects different light sources such as fluorescent light,
incandescent light, sunlight, and white LED with high accuracy ALS data output after detecting algorithm is implemented.
For proximity sensor function, VCNL4040 supports different kinds of mechanical designs to achieve the best proximity detection
performance for any color of object with more flexibility. The basic PS function settings, such as duty ratio, integration time,
interrupt, and PS enable / disable, and persistence, are handled by the register: PS_CONF1. Duty ratio controls the PS response
time. Integration time represents the duration of the energy being received. The interrupt is triggered when the PS detection
levels over the high threshold level setting (register: PS_THDH) or lower than low threshold (register: PS_THDL). If the interrupt
function is enabled, the host can react to the interrupt pin, instead of polling the PS data registers. The INT flag (register:
INT_Flag) indicates the type of interrupt that has been triggered, depending on the interrupt settings in the configuration
registers. PS persistence (PS_PERS) sets up the PS INT trigger conditions, defining the amount of consecutive hits required
before an interrupt event occurs. The intelligent cancellation level can be set on register: PS_CANC to reduce the cross talk
phenomenon.
VCNL4040 also supports an easy to use proximity detection logic mode, that triggers when the PS high threshold is exceeded
and automatically resets the interrupt pin when the proximity reading falls beneath the PS low threshold. This functionality can
be set in the register: PS_MS. A smart persistence is provided to be able to prevent false PS interrupt trigger events.
Descriptions of each of these parameters are shown in table 1.

VCNL4040
www.vishay.com Vishay Semiconductors
Adjustable Sampling Time
VCNL4040’s LED driver drives the internal IRED with the “LED CATHODE” pin by a pulsed duty cycle. The IRED on / off duty
ratio can be set in register: PS_Duty which is related to the current consumption and PS response time. The higher the duty
ratio, the faster the response time achieved with higher power consumption. For example, PS_Duty = 1/320, peak IRED current
= 100 mA, averaged current consumption is 100 mA/320 = 0.3125 mA.
Initialization
VCNL4040 includes default values for each register. As long as power is on, it is ready to be controlled by host via I2C bus.
Threshold Window Setting
• ALS Threshold Window Setting (Applying ALS INT)
Register: ALS_THDH_L and ALS_THDH_M defines 16-bit ALS high threshold data for LSB byte and MSB byte. Register:
ALS_THDL_L and ALS_THDL_M defines 16-bit ALS low threshold data for LSB byte and MSB byte. As long as ALS INT
function is enabled, INT will be triggered once the ALS data exceeds ALS_THDH or goes below ALS_THDL. To easily define
the threshold range, multiply the value of the resolution (lux/step) by the threshold level (refer to table 14).
• ALS Persistence
The ALS INT is triggered once the ALS value is higher or lower than the threshold window. The ALS_PERS (1, 2, 4, 8 times)
parameter, sets the amount of consecutive hits needed, in order for an interrupt event to trigger.
• Programmable PS Threshold
VCNL4040 provides both high and low thresholds setting for PS (register: PS_THDL, PS_THDH).
• PS Persistence
The PS persistence function (PS_PERS, 1, 2, 3, 4) helps to avoid false trigger of the PS INT. It defines the amount of
consecutive hits needed in order for a PS interrupt event to be triggered.
• PS Active Force mode
An extreme power saving way to use PS is to apply PS active force (register: PS_CONF3 command: PS_AF = 1) mode.
Anytime host would like to request one proximity measurement, write a ‘1’ into register: PS_CONF3 command: PS_Trig. This
triggers a single PS measurement, which can be read from the PS result registers. VCNL4040 stays in standby mode
constantly.
Data Access
All of VCNL4040 16 bit command registers are readable. The result data for ALS, white, and PS measurements can be read out
form their respective registers. Each result is made of 2 bytes.

VCNL4040
www.vishay.com Vishay Semiconductors
Interruption (INT)
The VCNL4040 has an interrupt feature for both the PS and ALS channel. The purpose of the interrupt feature is to actively
inform the host once INT has been triggered. When the interrupt is enabled, the host does not need to continuously read the
data registers of the sensor, but instead can simply react to the interrupt pin. As long as the host enables ALS interrupt (register:
ALS_INT_EN) or PS interrupt (register: PS_INT) function, the level of INT pin (pin 6) is pulled low once an interrupt event has
been triggered. All registers are accessible even if INT is triggered.
ALS INT is triggered when ALS value crosses over the value set in register: ALS_THDH or below the value set by
register: ALS_THDL. PS INT is triggered when the PS value crosses over the value set in register: PS_THDH or falls below the
value set in register: PS_THDL. Which of these thresholds to react to, can be set by the PS_INT bits in the register: PS_CONF2.
Interruption Flag
Register: INT_Flag represents all of the interrupt trigger statuses for ALS and PS. If any of these flags trigger from “0” to “1”,
the INT pin will be pulled low. Once the host reads INT_Flag register, all the flags are cleared (reset to "0"), and the INT pin is
reset to high.
PROXIMITY DETECTION LOGIC OUTPUT MODE
VCNL4040 has a proximity detection logic mode, enabling the host to read the state of PS (near or far) simply by monitoring the
INT pin (pin 6). When this mode is selected, the INT pin is pulled low when an object is close to the sensor (value is above high
threshold) and is reset to high when the object moves away (value is below low threshold). Register: PS_THDH / PS_THDL
define where these threshold levels are set.
It should be noted that whenever the proximity detection logic mode has been enabled, the INT pin only reacts to proximity
interrupt events. If the host would like to use ALS INT function, the bit PS_MS in the register: PS_MS needs to be set to normal
operation mode (PS_MS = 0). In order for the proximity detection logic mode to function, one of the PS_INT bits in register:
PS_CONF2 must be enabled (“trigger when close”, “trigger when away”, or “trigger when close or away”). If PS_INT is set to
“INT Disable” the proximity detection logic mode will not function.
PROXIMITY DETECTION HYSTERESIS
A hysteresis is created by setting the low and high threshold values. With proximity detection logic mode disabled, an interrupt
event will trigger and stay triggered until it is cleared in the INT_Flag register. The register is cleared automatically once it is read.
If the interrupt flags are not cleared after an interrupt event has occurred, the VCNL4040 will not react to another interrupt event
until the INT-Flag register has been cleared. An example of this could be when turning on and off a backlight of a mobile display.
First the PS INT triggers when the PS value is over PS_THDH. The host switches off the panel backlight and then clears INT.
When PS value is less than PS_THDL, host switches on panel backlight.

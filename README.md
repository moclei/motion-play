# Motion Play

A sensor-based system for detecting and tracking fast-moving objects through a plane, with LED feedback and wireless connectivity capabilities.

## Overview

Motion Play is an ESP32-based system that uses proximity sensors to detect and track fast-moving objects through a detection plane. The system can determine the direction of movement and provide visual feedback through LED lights. Multiple units can be networked together via Bluetooth, and the system can connect to WiFi networks or directly to a mobile device. This system is designed for games and sports performance training applications.
